# Module 4: Machine Learning

## üìö Overview
This folder contains all files related to the **Machine Learning** module of the Artificial Intelligence course (MSAI10).  
The goal of this module is to build, train, and evaluate various machine learning models using real or sample datasets.  
This assignment demonstrates both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques, along with model evaluation and interpretation.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives
- Understand the **machine learning pipeline** (data preparation ‚Üí training ‚Üí evaluation).  
- Implement core algorithms: **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and more.  
- Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE.  
- Visualize model results and analyze error patterns.
