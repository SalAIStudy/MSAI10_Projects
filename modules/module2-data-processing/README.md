# Module 2: Data Processing for AI

This module contains merged Pandas and SQL exercises for submission. DB-connection cells were skipped for safe execution; original code is preserved.

Files:
- assignment.ipynb (cleaned)
- assignment_executed.ipynb (executed; DB cells skipped)
- preprocess.py (script export; DB code commented out)
- report.md
- data/ (place CSV/JSON samples here)
- results/

How to run:
1. Put any required data files in `data/`.
2. Open `assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter and run cells.
