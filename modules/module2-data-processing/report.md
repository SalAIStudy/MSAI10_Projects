**Student:** Salma Areef Syed

**Date:** 2025-10-30

## Objective

Combine Pandas and SQL exercises demonstrating data loading, cleaning, and SQL-style queries.

## Notes on execution

- Cells that attempt to connect to external databases were **skipped** during automated execution for safety. Their original code is preserved in the notebook for instructor review.
- All other cells were executed; outputs are included in `assignment_executed.ipynb`.

## Reproducibility

Place any required CSV/JSON files in `data/` and run `assignment.ipynb` or `preprocess.py`.
