# Module 5: Linear Algebra

## üìö Overview
This folder contains all files related to the **Linear Algebra** module of the Artificial Intelligence course (MSAI10).  
The goal of this module is to develop a strong understanding of the mathematical foundations that underpin many AI and Machine Learning algorithms ‚Äî particularly vector spaces, matrices, and transformations.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives
- Understand core concepts of **vectors**, **matrices**, and **tensors**.  
- Perform basic **matrix operations** (addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse).  
- Compute **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**.  
- Apply linear algebra concepts to **AI and ML tasks** (e.g., PCA, transformations).
